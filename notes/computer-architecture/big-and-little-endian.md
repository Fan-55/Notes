# Big Endian and Little Endian

Big endian computers use leftmost byte (i.e., most significant byte, MSB) as word address. Little endian computers use rightmost byte (i.e., least significant byte, LSB) as word address. Most computers are byte addressable, meaning each byte in memory has a unique address.

**Address of a multi-byte object (like a word which is 4 bytes) is the lowest address of all the bytes it contains.** Endianess specifies the order in which bytes of a word are stored in memory.

[This is a video on youtube that explains this pretty well.](https://youtu.be/T1C9Kj_78ek?si=eHstmPmJsFtaZfb_)
